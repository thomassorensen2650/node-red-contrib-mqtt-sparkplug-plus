<script type="text/html" data-help-name="mqtt sparkplug device">
    <p>This node will connect to an MQTT Server and act as an MQTT Edge of Network (EoN) Node. The node handles the following message types:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>DBIRTH</li>
        <li>NCMD : REBIRTH</li>
        <li>NDEATH</li>
        <li>DDATA (from node input)</li>
        <li>DCMD (send as output to Node-Red)</li>
        <li>NBIRTH</li>
        <li>Buffering when Primary SCADA is OFFLINE or Broker Connection is down</li>
        <li>Compression</li>
    </ul>

  <p>The following features are not supported (yet):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Non-metrics (body/Metadata)</li>
        <li>MQTT Broker redundancy</li>
        <li>DDEATH</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <p>The easiest way to get started is to import the example node.</p>
    
    <p>You do that by pressing the Import button in Node-Red, and selecting the Examples Tab, and open the <i>node-red-contrib-mqtt-sparkplug-plus</i> - <b>Simple Device</b> Example</p>
    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <p>One or more metrics can be published by the device by passing the metrics information to the input of the device. A birth message will not be send before all metrics have been received at least once. so make sure to pass all metrics on start up.</p>
    <p>if a metric does not have a value then a "is_null" attribute is added to the metric</p>
    <p> Metric timestamps are optional per the specification. If timetamp are not supplied, then the current time will still be added to the DBIRTH message (nothing will be added to the DDATA). </p>

    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <pre>
        msg.payload = {
            "metrics": [
                {
                    "name": "testing/test1",
                    // Timestamp  is optional.
                    "timestamp" : new Date(),
                    "value": 11
                },
                {
                    "name": "testing/test2",
                    "value": 12
                }
            ]
        };
    </pre>

    <h4>Dynamic Inputs</h4>
    <p>Metrics definitions should normally be setup via the UI, but in some cases its beneficial to configure the metrics via code. This can be done by configuring the metrics using the msg.definition attribute.</p>
    <p>The following example shows a message that also sets the definition. DO NOT include definition is each message, as it will trigger rebirth each time a valid msg.definition is processed by the node.</p>
    <p>Setting metrics dynamicly also also allows you to set properties (like engineering units) for the metrics. This functionality is currently not supported when configuring metrics via the UI.</p>
    <p>The example belows shows how to set definitions via code (payload is optional):</p>
    <pre>
        msg = {
            "definition" : {
                "TEST/TEST" : {
                    "dataType" : "Int32",
                    "properties": {
                        "engUnits": {
                            "type": "String",
                            "value": "inHg"
                        }
                    }, 
                }
            },
            "payload" : {
                "metrics" : [
                {
                    "name" : "TEST/TEST",
                    "value" : 5
                }]
            }
        };
    </pre>

       <h3>Sparkplug Message Types</h3>
       The connection node will handle the following messages:
       <h4>NBIRTH</h4>
        <p>Node Birth will be send by the node when the node-red runtime has started and the node has a connection the the MQTT Broker. This message will also be send when a "Rebirth" NCMD is received</p>
        <h4>NCMD</h4>
        The MQTT Sparkplug Device node will handle the following messages:
        <p>The node will handle incoming NCMD commands (currently only Rebirth is supported)</p>
        <h4>NDEATH</h4>
        <p>The node will send NDEATH when node-red runtime is stopped (it will be send on both a gracefull shutdown and a unexpected shutdown).</p>
        <h4>DBIRTH</h4>
        <p>Node Birth will be send by the node when all metrics have been received at least once, the node-red runtime has started and the node has a connection the the MQTT Broker. This message will also be send when a "Rebirth" NCMD is received</p>
        <h4>DCMD</h4>
        <p>NCMDs will be send to the node output port.</p>
        <h4>DDEATH</h4>
        <p>DDEATH is not currently supported.</p>

        <h3>Details</h3>
        The subscription topic can include MQTT wildcards, + for one level, # for multiple levels.</p>
        <p>This node requires a connection to a MQTT broker to be configured. This is configured by clicking
        the pencil icon.</p>
        <p>Several MQTT nodes (in or out) can share the same broker connection if required.</p>
</script>

<script type="text/html" data-help-name="mqtt-sparkplug-broker">
    <p>Configuration for a connection to an MQTT broker.</p>
    <p>This configuration will create a single connection to the broker which can
       then be reused by <code>MQTT Sparkplug In</code> and <code>MQTT Sparkplug Device</code> nodes.</p>
    <p>The node will generate a random Client ID if one is not set and the
       node is configured to use a Clean Session connection. If a Client ID is set,
       it must be unique to the broker you are connecting to.</p>
    <h4>WebSockets</h4>
    <p>The node can be configured to use a WebSocket connection. To do so, the Server
       field should be configured with a full URI for the connection. For example:</p>
    <pre>ws://example.com:4000/mqtt</pre>

    <h3>Sparkplug</h3>
    <h4>Name</h4>
    <p>This is the name of the EoN node. This name will be part of all topics. The name is used to identify the EoN node    </p>
    <h4>Group</h4>
    <p>This is the device group. This will be part of the Topic of all messages, and can be used to group related EoN nodes</p>
    <h4>Enable Store Forward </h4>
    <p>This will enable store forward if the Primary SCADA is offline</p>
    <h4>Destination</h4>
    <p>This is the name of the Primary SCADA. If store forward is enabled and the STATE/[PRIMARY SCADA NAME] is OFFLINE, then data will be buffered until connection is reestablished.</p>
    <p>The data will be buffered via the <a href="https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/context">Node-Red Context Store.</a>. The default Context store is only stored in memory, but it can be modified to be stored to Disk (or other places) by changing the default Context store location on Node-Red. See more about context <a href="https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/context">here</a></p>
    <p><b><u>The full set of buffered data will be kep in memory, so do not use this feature for high thoughput applications. (or make sure that you have a enough RAM)</u></b></p>

    <h3>Details</h3>
    <code>msg.payload</code> is used as the payload of the published message.
    If it contains an Object it will be converted to a JSON string before being sent.
    If it contains a binary Buffer the message will be published as-is.</p>
    <p>The topic used can be configured in the node or, if left blank, can be set by <code>msg.topic</code>.</p>
    <p>Likewise the QoS and retain values can be configured in the node or, if left
    blank, set by <code>msg.qos</code> and <code>msg.retain</code> respectively. To clear a previously
    retained topic from the broker, send a blank message to that topic with the retain flag set.</p>
    <p>This node requires a connection to a MQTT broker to be configured. This is configured by clicking
    the pencil icon.</p>
    <p>Several MQTT Sparkplug nodes (in, out or device) can share the same broker connection if required.</p>
    <p>This node will not buffer by default</p>
